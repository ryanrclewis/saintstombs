**Why this website?**

This website was more than two decades in the making. It grew out of
several trips to Italy---beginning in 2003---during which I visited the
tombs of saints in small towns. It also arose from experiences in large
cities, standing in beautiful churches and wondering whether a saint
might be buried there, then quietly searching for the tomb so I could
pray.

Over time, I realized that many other Christians share this desire: to
make pilgrimages to the tombs of Servants of God, venerables, blesseds,
and saints, and to pray at or near their relics. I wanted to create
something to support that devotion---and to make it freely available.

My dream and reason for creating this website is so that people will
plan pilgrimages around the material and will gain graces and maybe even
favors received from doing so. If they can visit on the person's feast
day or *dies natalis*, that would be even better.

**The website's structure**

Countries with many saints have their own pages. Other nations---where
fewer saints are known or where causes are still developing---are
grouped by region (for example, Oceania or Eastern Europe). Spain and
France also include nearby microstates such as Andorra and Monaco.

Within each country, towns are listed alphabetically. This allows the
site to be used practically while traveling. For example, if you are
driving along the Autostrada A24 in Italy and see that you are
approaching Tagliacozzo, you can look it up, exit the motorway, and
visit the Church of San Francesco to pray at the tomb of Blessed Tommaso
da Celano, OFM, friar and author, whose feast day is October 4. You can
also learn that St. Oddone di Novara (Odo of Novara), O.Cart. died
there, even though his burial place is uncertain.

**What to know about using these pages**

- Towns are listed alphabetically within each country or region.

- Bold dots indicate churches, shrines, or cemeteries.

- Open dots beneath them list the individual(s) buried there.

Here is an example:

Andover Township, Sussex County, New Jersey

- St. Paul Abbey Cemetery

  - Servant of God Marinus (née Leonard) LaRue, OSB,
    sailor/religious, d. 10/14/2001

If you see "???" next to a bold dot, it means one of two things:

- The person died in that town, but the burial location is unknown; or

- The person is believed to be buried there, but the exact site is
  uncertain.

There are question marks for places such as Dachau or Auschwitz because
the people there died and were buried at those places, but the remains
of the holy men and women who died there were mostly cremated.

**What to keep in mind**

Nearly all of this research was conducted using online sources. Anyone
who has done serious research on the internet knows that information can
sometimes be incomplete or incorrect. A source may claim that a saint is
buried in a particular church, only for that information to prove
unreliable.

Christianity is nearly 2,000 years old. Over that time, churches have
been rebuilt, destroyed, or abandoned, and tombs have been moved or
lost. For example, the great Church of St. Simeon Stylites near Aleppo
still stands in ruins, but the saint's grave is no longer identifiable.

Because of this, it is always best---when possible---to contact the
church, monastery, or pilgrimage site before visiting.

Even when a grave can no longer be identified, the visit itself can
still be meaningful. Many ruins remain places of beauty and prayer, and
it is very possible that the remains of the holy still lie beneath them.

**A request**

If you discover any errors on this website, or know of a Servant of God,
Venerable, Blessed, or Saint whose burial place is not listed here,
please let me know via the <a href="/contact.html">Contact</a> page.

Also, if you make it to any of these places, please say a prayer for me
there, too. Know that I am praying for you.
